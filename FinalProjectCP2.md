1)Planned: "Turn in additional features such as leader board capabilities and better 3d graph- ics."

2)Acomplished: None of the above. Reason: grossly overestimated the time it would take to create a mobile application game. Currently am working out many bugs in the gameplay itself. I could create a leaderboard and better graphics but they would be completely useless because the game is so buggy. It is so tedious to debug a mobile game because you need to keep playing the game to find the bugs and they dont happen every time, only in very specific conditions, and trying to recreate those conditions is very dificult.  

3)Planned for next time: Fix Bugs, admendments: going to use copyright graphics until I learn photoshop, going to forgo leaderboard due to time constraints

Bugs:

1) Glitch on second level where player respawns where he originally hit the bucket, instead of starting position.
2) Need to remove minicubes when they contact the ground so that the score doesnt change when the next level starts
3)Level 3+ towers are not being deleted 
4)Need tiled ground that can only register a minicube hit once and then is deemed null 
5)Need cube to respawn the first time the game is closed not the second. 
6)Some towers have missing spot where cube can travel through them?
7)Glitch where cube gets stuck in bucket causing an infinite spawn of minicubes
8)Towers spawning on top of each other.
9)Need the ground to move and respawn with the towers to make it look like the cube is flying through the screen. 

4)Screenshots on repository already (they would look exactly the same as whats already on there)
