//THINGS TO TIGHTEN UP
//1) Bug: minicube can hit player =>may be fixed by playing on iphone or next bug fix
//2) Bug (Rare): Infinite minicube spawn=> fixed by Reduce the number of cubes that can spwan on each consecutive minicube towertop hit (reset it when player is tossed again
//3) Bug: Tile hits arent always detected => fixed with new smaller tile graphics
//5) Move Score Singelton in to player class
//6) Get rid of use of dificulty.numTowers and use local variables
//8) Make Bacground and tilemap move with towers so it looks like everything is moving
//9) Use better programing grammar(move bucket spawn in to bucket class)
//10) Make my own graphics
